In uvm-101, we created a basic testbench structure with only "test" and "env".
That was just enough to utilize a UVM component, and print "Hello UVM". But, in 
a normal testbench we would have a data element that gets routed through diff.
components. So, in this part, we will create a "data" packet object and send 
it to the "driver". 

Test                 uvm-101
Environment          uvm-101

Data Packet          uvm-201
Driver               uvm-201

As you might know already, the data packet is an abstract form of information
that encapsulates a lot of information into a single entity - class object. We
may not need all the information in the data object to drive signals to DUT.
The driver obtains the data packet and extracts the required information and
converts it into the pin-wiggles of DUT interface.
