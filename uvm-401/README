In uvm-301, we built our sequencer and monitor and it looks almost complete. 
There's a packet generator, a driver to drive that packet to the DUT, a monitor 
that will listen for activity on the DUT ports and a sequencer to operate on
sequences.

In this session, let us create a scoreboard, and put the 3 compnonents, 
[sequencer, driver, monitor] inside something called as an "agent". An agent is
supposed to be a standalone component that can be instantiated in any environment.
The interesting part is that an agent can be developed for each bus protocol, and
you can just plug in/ instantiate the agent in the environment and it will be
ready to use. We'll also see how the scoreboard is connected with the monitor
inside the agent.

In previous sessions, we used to get the DUT IF from the top level module inside
the environment and pass it to the agent. From now on, we'll put the interface
handle inside a configuration object, and pass the configuration object to the
agent. The cfg object can have many other types of configuration parameters as
well in addition to holding the interface handle. Basically, it should contain
everything needed for an agent to configure itself and its sub-components.
